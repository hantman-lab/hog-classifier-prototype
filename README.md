This demo uses logistic regression to classify the "lift" behavior of a reach-to-grab task in mice. The left plot show the raw footage from a trial and the right plot shows the corresponding HOG features calculated dynamically. As the trial progresses, the results of the logistic classification for the "lift" behavior can be seen. This implementation will serve as a basis for the development of an automated animal behavioral classification software using GPU.
